# Video Looping Fix for 8-12 Second Videos

## Problem Description

The VBVA system was experiencing a critical issue where videos with audio duration between 8-12 seconds were producing incorrect output with audio looping over random sentences from the LLM answer. This was happening because:

1. **Unnecessary Audio Splitting**: The system was splitting audio in the 8-12 second range into chunks, even though this range is optimal for single video generation
2. **Audio Synchronization Issues**: The video combination process had timestamp synchronization problems causing audio to loop
3. **FFmpeg DTS Errors**: "Non-monotonic DTS" errors were corrupting the audio timeline during concatenation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Audio Splitting Logic Issue
The original logic was splitting any audio longer than 8 seconds, which included the optimal 8-12 second range. This unnecessary splitting introduced complexity and potential for errors.

### Video Combination Problems
The FFmpeg concatenation was using `-c copy` for both video and audio, which doesn't handle timestamp synchronization properly when combining multiple video segments.

### Audio Duration Mismatch
The TTS was generating longer audio than expected, pushing content into the problematic splitting range.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Optimized Video Generation Strategy

**Modified `_generate_video_ultra_fast()` in `services/ultra_fast_processor.py`:**

```python
# Ultra-fast processing strategy
if audio_duration <= 8:  # Very short content
    print(f"üé¨ Using single video generation for short audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_single_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
elif audio_duration <= 12:  # Optimal range - avoid splitting to prevent looping
    print(f"üé¨ Using single video generation for optimal audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_single_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
else:
    print(f"üé¨ Using parallel video generation for longer audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_parallel_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added explicit handling for 8-12 second audio range
- Prevents unnecessary splitting for optimal duration content
- Maintains single video generation for this range

### 2. Improved Video Combination Process

**Enhanced `_combine_videos_ultra_fast()` method:**

```python
# Improved FFmpeg command with proper audio synchronization
cmd = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-f", "concat",
    "-safe", "0",
    "-i", file_list_path,
    "-c:v", "copy",  # Copy video without re-encoding
    "-c:a", "aac",   # Re-encode audio to ensure proper sync
    "-b:a", "128k",  # Audio bitrate
    "-ar", "24000",  # Audio sample rate to match Wav2Lip output
    "-movflags", "+faststart",
    "-avoid_negative_ts", "make_zero",  # Handle negative timestamps
    "-fflags", "+genpts",  # Generate presentation timestamps
    output_path,
    "-y"
]
```

**Key Improvements:**
- `-c:a aac`: Re-encodes audio for proper synchronization
- `-ar 24000`: Matches Wav2Lip's audio sample rate
- `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero`: Handles timestamp issues
- `-fflags +genpts`: Generates proper presentation timestamps

### 3. Enhanced Audio Splitting Logic

**Improved `_split_audio_ultra_fast()` method:**

```python
# Improved chunking logic to prevent very short chunks
if remainder > 0:
    if remainder < 1.0:
        # If remainder is less than 1 second, distribute it among existing chunks
        print(f"üéµ Adjusting chunking to avoid very short chunks (remainder: {remainder:.2f}s)")
        # Adjust chunk duration to distribute remainder evenly
        chunk_duration = duration / num_chunks
        print(f"üéµ Using {num_chunks} chunks of ~{chunk_duration:.2f}s each")
    else:
        # Add one more chunk for the remainder
        num_chunks += 1
        print(f"üéµ Splitting into {num_chunks} chunks of ~{chunk_duration:.2f}s each")
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Better handling of remainder chunks
- Prevents very short chunks that cause processing issues
- Improved chunk duration distribution

### 4. Fallback Combination Method

**Added `_combine_videos_fallback()` method:**

```python
async def _combine_videos_fallback(self, video_paths: List[str], output_path: str) -> str:
    """Fallback video combination method with re-encoding"""
    
    # Fallback FFmpeg command with re-encoding for better compatibility
    cmd = [
        "ffmpeg",
        "-f", "concat",
        "-safe", "0",
        "-i", file_list_path,
        "-c:v", "libx264",  # Re-encode video
        "-preset", "ultrafast",
        "-crf", "23",
        "-c:a", "aac",
        "-b:a", "128k",
        "-ar", "24000",
        "-movflags", "+faststart",
        "-avoid_negative_ts", "make_zero",
        "-fflags", "+genpts",
        output_path,
        "-y"
    ]
```

**Key Features:**
- Complete re-encoding for maximum compatibility
- Handles cases where copy mode fails
- Provides last-resort combination method

# Video Looping Fix for 12+ Second Videos

## Problem Description

The VBVA system was experiencing a critical issue where videos with audio duration of 12+ seconds were producing incorrect output with video looping over certain parts of the LLM answer instead of covering the complete response. This was happening because:

1. **Audio-Video Synchronization Issues**: The video combination process had timestamp synchronization problems causing audio to loop
2. **Chunk Processing Errors**: Individual video chunks were not being processed with consistent parameters
3. **FFmpeg Combination Problems**: The video concatenation process had issues with proper ordering and synchronization
4. **Wav2Lip Parameter Inconsistency**: Different chunks were processed with varying parameters causing sync issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Video Combination Synchronization Issue
The main issue was in the `_combine_videos_ultra_fast()` method where:
- Video files were not being properly validated before combination
- FFmpeg parameters were not optimized for audio synchronization
- Missing audio sync correction parameters

### Chunk Processing Inconsistency
Individual chunks were being processed with different Wav2Lip parameters, leading to:
- Inconsistent FPS across chunks
- Different batch sizes causing timing variations
- Lack of proper error handling for failed chunks

### Audio Splitting Problems
The audio splitting process had issues with:
- Improper chunk ordering
- Missing validation for chunk continuity
- Insufficient error handling for malformed chunks

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Video Combination Process

```python
async def _combine_videos_ultra_fast(self, video_paths: List[str]) -> str:
    """Combine videos with ultra-fast settings and improved synchronization"""
    
    # Verify all video files exist and have content
    valid_video_paths = []
    for i, video_path in enumerate(local_video_paths):
        if os.path.exists(video_path) and os.path.getsize(video_path) > 0:
            valid_video_paths.append(video_path)
            print(f"‚úÖ Video {i+1} verified: {video_path}")
        else:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Video {i+1} missing or empty: {video_path}")
    
    # Improved FFmpeg command with better synchronization
    cmd = [
        "ffmpeg",
        "-f", "concat",
        "-safe", "0",
        "-i", file_list_path,
        "-c:v", "copy",  # Copy video without re-encoding
        "-c:a", "aac",   # Re-encode audio to ensure proper sync

    """Run Wav2Lip with ultra-fast parameters and improved synchronization"""
    
    # Get audio duration to adjust parameters
    audio_duration = await self._get_audio_duration_fast(audio_path)
    
    # Adjust parameters based on audio duration for better synchronization
    if audio_duration <= 4:
        fps = 10  # Lower FPS for very short content
        batch_size = 32
    elif audio_duration <= 8:
        fps = 10  # Standard FPS for short content
        batch_size = 64
    else:
        fps = 10  # Consistent FPS for longer content
        batch_size = 64
    
    cmd = [
        "python", "inference.py",
        "--checkpoint_path", "checkpoints/wav2lip.pth",
        "--face", avatar_path,
        "--audio", audio_path,
        "--outfile", output_path,
        "--static", "True",
        "--fps", str(fps),  # Consistent FPS for better sync
        "--resize_factor", "6",  # Maximum resize for speed
        "--pads", "0", "2", "0", "0",  # Minimal padding
        "--wav2lip_batch_size", str(batch_size),  # Adjusted batch size

    ]
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Consistent FPS across all chunks (10 FPS)
- Duration-based parameter adjustment
- Better error handling and validation
- Output file verification

### 3. Enhanced Audio Splitting Logic

**Improved `_split_audio_ultra_fast()` method:**

```python
async def _split_audio_ultra_fast(self, audio_path: str) -> List[str]:
    """Split audio into ultra-small chunks for maximum speed with improved synchronization"""
    
    # Check for all possible chunk files and sort them properly
    for i in range(num_chunks + 2):  # Check a few extra in case of rounding issues
        chunk_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, f"chunk_{i:03d}.mp3")
        if os.path.exists(chunk_path) and os.path.getsize(chunk_path) > 0:
            # Get duration of this chunk
            chunk_duration_actual = await self._get_audio_duration_fast(chunk_path)
            if chunk_duration_actual > 0.1:  # Only include chunks with meaningful duration
                total_chunk_duration += chunk_duration_actual
                chunk_files.append(chunk_path)
                print(f"‚úÖ Chunk {i}: {chunk_duration_actual:.2f}s")
            else:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Chunk {i} too short, skipping: {chunk_duration_actual:.2f}s")
        else:
            # Stop when we find the first missing chunk
            break
    
    # Ensure chunks are in correct order
    chunk_files.sort()
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Better chunk validation and filtering
- Proper chunk ordering
- Duration verification
- Improved error handling

### 4. Video Generation Strategy Optimization

**Maintained optimal strategy in `_generate_video_ultra_fast()`:**

```python
# Ultra-fast processing strategy
if audio_duration <= 8:  # Very short content
    print(f"üé¨ Using single video generation for short audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_single_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
elif audio_duration <= 12:  # Optimal range - avoid splitting to prevent looping
    print(f"üé¨ Using single video generation for optimal audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_single_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
else:
    print(f"üé¨ Using parallel video generation for longer audio ({audio_duration:.2f}s)")
    video_url = await self._generate_parallel_video_ultra_fast(audio_url, agent_type)
```

**Key Strategy:**
- 8-12 second range uses single video generation to avoid splitting issues
